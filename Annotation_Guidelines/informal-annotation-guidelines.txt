Annotation Procedure:

1) Create a separate file for your annotation.  The goal is to just
find the first 5-10 examples. I am providing 3 files just in case, but
look at the files in the following order

2) Initially, we will mark +CAUSE and +BEFORE-AFTER relations, but we
will not mark any -CAUSE relations

3) For each sentence, check whether there are any potential functors.

4) Determine if each functor links 2 clauses within the sentence or if
they link that sentence with the previous sentence.

5) If there are no functors in the current sentence, attempt to
determine if a relation exists between that sentence and the previous
sentence.

6) Be aware that factors can contain the conjunctions "and" or "or".  For example:

"Before [Mary could say anything], [the cat jumped and the dog barked]"
Relation = +BEFORE-AFTER
Factor1 = Mary could say anything
Factor2 = the cat jumped and the dog barked
